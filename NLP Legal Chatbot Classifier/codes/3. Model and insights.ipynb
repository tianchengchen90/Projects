So they may not be really false positives. Others are badly crafted grammatically where the meaning is vague (ie. 632) that can end up confusing the learning model."

       "9007  im feeling conflicted about a workplace situation can i get some advice so i work in a small office with a about  people a day different people for different days of the week  were all scanning clerks scan some docs shred the paper take out the shreds to the trash go find more boxes of documents at a separate location  rinse repeat  i also happen to work with both of my parents  me and my dad started together and my mom about a month later  we needed to find work and someone knew a guy and told us to apply  that someone well call her jane also started working the same time i did  we kinda knew jane pretty extroverted and a little weird but not too much to make any judgements you know  anyways after the first week working with her it became pretty apparent that she was full blown princess because she always weasels her way into making others do the heavy lifting stuff getting boxes and taking the trash  she claims theyre too heavy and shes being modest of what she can manage  while were all doing what were required she makes up for it by sweeping any paper on the floor  or saying she can put the door stopper whenever we get boxes  you know the not hard stuff  and idk about anyone else but sweeping hurts my back more than getting boxes  she also lied to my face about not knowing how to lock a door because i saw her open it before  keep in mind jane is early s  my mom is sick of her antics and continues to tell me dont do anything for her  she can figure it out you or anyone else shouldnt be her personal assistant  my mom is the kind who calls crap out like it is and is used to being painted as the bad guy because she takes crap from no one  my dad is aware of all this idiocracy but hes a bit nicer and tolerates jane and then vents in the car on the ride home  my conflict comes from being told not to help jane with anything but my conscience just cant help it  i dont feel bad far from i curse under my breath every time she ask for help  but i cant just sit there and not have the workflow go to a halt  at the moment all three of us are already thinking of finding a new job not just because of jane but because the work itself and the drive over isnt worth being paid   so any advice for me on what i should do  and sorry for the semi rant its been a rough week so far   \n",

    "Also, there were several instances of use of shortforms and spelling errors in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve on the data, should an organisation want to proceed further, logging in new data with high integrity would be helpful. This is to prevent the situation of garbage in garbarge out.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Law terms are different across all countries\n",
    "A challenge when implementing the classifier is that legal jargons can be very different across different countries. There must be a sizable number of data to train the model to become more accurate. Thus, the current model would take time to be implemented across different countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Differences in language and slangs\n",
    "Word choices can be different across different cultures. Even amidst the english language, the British, Americans and Australians for example will have their own colloquial ways of writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the model is built on existing data from Reddit based on the english language. There will be a limitation of language as such. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hyperparameters tuning for Random Forest, also use of other models\n",
    "In my process, I have opted to run RandomizedSearch instead of GridSearch for the two Random Forest models. Perhaps the accuracy rates could have been improved further, and if organisation have the capability and investment to process the model quick enough, they may get a different model choice compared to me. Use of other models, like SVM and Boosting to improve accuracy can also be explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Merely one step in the correct direction\n",
    "Other classifier related to suicide, depression, and defamation can also be paired with this legal query classifier. My classifier alone will not be sufficient to cover all liabilities legally."
